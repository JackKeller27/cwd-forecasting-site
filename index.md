## Summary
Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a fatal, prion-based disease that affects deer populations (i.e., cervids) worldwide. As the disease spreads, an important question arises: how will it influence human behavior, particularly the hunting and consumption of cervids -- especially white-tailed deer in the Midwest and Southeast U.S. -- through disease-management policies? We propose a hybrid machine learning-mechanistic model to forecast the spread of CWD in these regions to better understand its potential impact on human behavior. The model consists of a graph neural network (GNN) whose loss function incorporates a metapopulation-SIR model using the physics-informed neural network (PINNs) framework. This approach captures both the spatial and temporal dynamics of disease transmission while remaining grounded in epidemiological constraints.
